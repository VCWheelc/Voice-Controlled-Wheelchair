# Component Description
- <sub> **L298N:** The L298N is a dual full-bridge motor driver integrated circuit that is capable of driving two DC motors or one stepper motor. It can handle a maximum voltage of 46V and a peak current of 3A per bridge. The L298N also features built-in protection circuits to prevent damage from over-temperature, over-voltage, and over-current conditions. </sub>
- <sub> **Raspberry Pi 3 :** The Raspberry Pi 3 is a single-board computer with a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor running at 1.2 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, and built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It has four USB ports, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a 3.5mm audio jack for versatile connectivity. The Raspberry Pi 3 is commonly used for educational and hobbyist projects, as well as for low-power server applications. </sub>
- <sub> **SPH0645:** The SPH0645 is a digital MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) microphone module that converts sound waves into digital signals using a PDM (Pulse-Density Modulation) output. It has a sensitivity of -26 dBFS and a signal-to-noise ratio of 65 dBA. The SPH0645 requires a supply voltage of 1.6 to 3.6 V and is commonly used in voice-activated applications, such as smart speakers and voice assistants. </sub>
  
# Project Discription
- <sub>Innovative assistive technology called a voice-controlled wheelchair project enables people with disabilities to control a wheelchair using their voice. People who have restricted movement in their hands or arms can benefit the most from this technology, which will provide them more freedom and mobility.The project typically entails pairing a voice recognition system with a motorised wheelchair that can move, change pace, turn, and stop in response to spoken orders. A variety of devices, including microphones, microcontrollers, motors, sensors, and specially programmed software, can be used to accomplish this.</sub>
- <sub>The system can be tailored to the user's unique requirements, such as recognising and responding to a particular user's voice or being programmed to respond to particular instructions or words that are significant to the user. Additionally, sensors can be utilised to find risks or impediments in the course of the wheelchair, giving the user feedback and assuring safety.The quality of life for people with impairments could be dramatically improved by a voice-controlled wheelchair project. It offers more freedom and mobility, as well as reducing the physical exhaustion and strain that come with using a wheelchair the old-fashioned way. This project serves as an example of how technology may be used to increase accessibility and inclusivity for individuals with disabilities.</sub>
