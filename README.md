# Component Description
- <sub> **L298N:** The L298N is a dual full-bridge motor driver integrated circuit that is capable of driving two DC motors or one stepper motor. It can handle a maximum voltage of 46V and a peak current of 3A per bridge. The L298N also features built-in protection circuits to prevent damage from over-temperature, over-voltage, and over-current conditions. </sub>
- <sub> **RaspberryPi 3 :** The Raspberry Pi 3 is a single-board computer with a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor running at 1.2 GHz, 1 GB of RAM, and built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It has four USB ports, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port, and a 3.5mm audio jack for versatile connectivity. The Raspberry Pi 3 is commonly used for educational and hobbyist projects, as well as for low-power server applications. </sub>
- <sub> **SPH0645:** The SPH0645 is a digital MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) microphone module that converts sound waves into digital signals using a PDM (Pulse-Density Modulation) output. It has a sensitivity of -26 dBFS and a signal-to-noise ratio of 65 dBA. The SPH0645 requires a supply voltage of 1.6 to 3.6 V and is commonly used in voice-activated applications, such as smart speakers and voice assistants. </sub>
